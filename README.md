SideX is a port of Visual Studio Code that replaces Electron with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) — a Rust backend and OS's native webview. The same TypeScript workbench, the same editor, terminal, and Git integration, running without a bundled browser.

> **Early release.** Core editing and the terminal are solid. The extension host and debugger are still in progress. See [What's Working](#whats-working) for the full picture.

---

## Why

VSCode's memory useage is almost entirely from its bundled Chromium, not the editor itself. Tauri replaces that with the webview already on your system — WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on Windows — shared across apps and costing almost nothing extra.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/compare.jpg" alt="SideX 16.4 MB vs Visual Studio Code 797.8 MB" width="760">
</p>

RAM savings are most tested on macOS, WKWebView is shared with Safari. On Windows the picture is more nuanced — WebView2 memory can look higher depending on how it's measured, and [it's an active area in the Tauri ecosystem](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5889). The target is **under 200 MB at idle** on macOS. We'll publish real benchmarks once the app is stable enough for them to be meaningful.

## What's Working

**Solid:**

- Monaco editor with syntax highlighting and basic IntelliSense
- File explorer — open folders, create, rename, delete
- Integrated terminal — full PTY via Rust, shell detection, resize, signals
- Git — status, diff, log, stage, commit, branch, push/pull/fetch, stash, reset
- Themes — multiple built-in themes from the VSCode catalogue
- Native OS menus (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Extension installation from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/)
- File watching, file search, full-text search, Rust-backed search index
- SQLite storage, document management (autosave, undo/redo, encoding)

## Getting Started

### Run in Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sidenai/sidex.git
cd sidex
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build from Source

```bash
npm install

# macOS / Linux
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=12288" npm run build

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=12288"
npm run build

npx tauri build
```

First build takes 5–10 minutes (Rust compile time). Pre-built binaries are not distributed yet.

## How It's Built

SideX maps VSCode's Electron architecture onto Tauri layer by layer:

| VSCode (Electron) | SideX (Tauri) |
|---|---|
| Electron main process | Tauri Rust backend |
| `BrowserWindow` | `WebviewWindow` |
| `ipcMain` / `ipcRenderer` | `invoke()` + Tauri events |
| Node.js `fs`, `pty`, etc. | Rust commands (`std::fs`, `portable-pty`) |
| Menu / Dialog / Clipboard | Tauri plugins |
| Renderer (DOM + TypeScript) | Same — runs in native webview |
| Extension host | Sidecar process (in progress) |

The TypeScript frontend is a direct port of VSCode's workbench. The Rust backend is in `src-tauri/src/commands/` and handles everything that would have been a Node.js native module: file I/O, terminal PTY, Git, file watching, search indexing, SQLite, and process management.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | TypeScript, Vite 6, Monaco Editor |
| Terminal UI | xterm.js + WebGL renderer |
| Syntax / Themes | vscode-textmate, vscode-oniguruma (WASM) |
| Backend | Rust, Tauri 2 |
| Terminal | portable-pty (Rust) |
| File watching | notify crate (FSEvents on macOS) |
| Search | dashmap + rayon + regex (parallel, Rust) |
| Storage | SQLite via rusqlite |
| Extensions | Open VSX registry |

## Contributing

This was released early to get outside contributors involved.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a branch
2. Pick something — check [Issues](https://github.com/Sidenai/sidex/issues) or grab something from the Known Gaps list above
3. Submit a PR — contributors get credited

### Dev Notes

- Follows VSCode's patterns — familiar if you've read the VSCode source
- TypeScript imports use `.js` extensions (ES module convention)
- Services use VSCode's `@inject` dependency injection decorators
- New Rust commands go in `src-tauri/src/commands/` and register in `lib.rs`
